# Software Test Report (STR)

This document follows DI-IPSC-81440 - Software Test Report.

## Purpose

The Software Test Report (STR) records the results of qualification testing
performed on a Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI) or software system.
It documents the test results, identifies any deviations from expected results,
and provides an assessment of the software's qualification status.

## Building

Run `sysdoc build` to generate the final document.

## Structure

- `src/01_scope/` - Identification, system overview, document overview, Section 508 compliance
- `src/02_referenced_documents/` - Referenced documents
- `src/03_overview_of_test_results/` - Overall assessment, test environment, summary of results
- `src/04_detailed_test_results/` - Individual test results
- `src/05_test_log/` - Chronological record of test activities
- `src/06_requirements_traceability/` - Requirements traceability
- `src/07_notes/` - General information, acronyms, glossary
- `src/appendices/` - Appendices

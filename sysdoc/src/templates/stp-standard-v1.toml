# Software Test Plan (STP)

This document follows DI-IPSC-81438 - Software Test Plan.

## Purpose

The Software Test Plan (STP) describes plans for qualification testing of Computer
Software Configuration Items (CSCIs) and software systems. It describes the software
test environment to be used for the testing, identifies the tests to be performed,
and provides schedules for test activities.

## Building

Run `sysdoc build` to generate the final document.

## Structure

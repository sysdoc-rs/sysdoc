3. System-wide design decisions. This section shall be divided into paragraphs as
needed to present system-wide design decisions, that is, decisions about the system's behavioral
design (how it will behave, from a user's point of view, in meeting its requirements, ignoring
internal implementation) and other decisions affecting the selection and design of system
components. If all such decisions are explicit in the requirements or are deferred to the design of
the system components, this section shall so state. Design decisions that respond to requirements
designated critical, such as those for safety, security, or privacy, shall be placed in separate
subparagraphs. If a design decision depends upon system states or modes, this dependency shall
be indicated. Design conventions needed to understand the design shall be presented or
referenced. Examples of system-wide design decisions are the following:

a. Design decisions regarding inputs the system will accept and outputs it will produce,
including interfaces with other systems, configuration items, and users (4.3.x of this DID
identifies topics to be considered in this description). If part or all of this information is given in
Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs), they may be referenced.

b. Design decisions on system behavior in response to each input or condition, including
actions the system will perform, response times and other performance characteristics,
description of physical systems modeled, selected equations/algorithms/rules, and handling of
unallowed inputs or conditions.

c. Design decisions on how system databases/data files will appear to the user (4.3.x of
this DID identifies topics to be considered in this description). If part or all of this information is
given in Database Design Descriptions (DBDDs), they may be referenced.

d. Selected approach to meeting safety, security, and privacy requirements.

e. Design and construction choices for hardware or hardware-software systems, such as
physical size, color, shape, mass, materials, and markings.

f. Other system-wide design decisions made in response to requirements, such as
selected approach to providing required flexibility, availability, and maintainability.

relationships may be presented, depending on the selected design methodology.

c. State the purpose of each component and identify the system requirements and
system-wide design decisions allocated to it. (Alternatively, the allocation of requirements may
be provided in 5.a.)

d. Identify each component's development status/type, if known (such as new
development, existing component to be reused as is, existing design to be reused as is, existing
design or component to be reengineered, component to be developed for reuse, component

components, shall include, as applicable, manufacturer name and model number, data transfer
rates/capacities, network topologies, transmission techniques, and protocols used.

   6) Each description shall also include, as applicable, growth capabilities,

# Software Test Description (STD)

This document follows DI-IPSC-81439 - Software Test Description.

## Purpose

The Software Test Description (STD) describes test cases and test procedures to be
used to perform qualification testing of a Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI)
or software system. It provides detailed test cases, test procedures, and the expected
results for each test identified in the Software Test Plan (STP).

## Building

Run `sysdoc build` to generate the final document.

## Structure

- `src/01_scope/` - Identification, system overview, document overview, Section 508 compliance
- `src/02_referenced_documents/` - Referenced documents
- `src/03_test_preparations/` - Hardware preparation, software preparation, other pre-test preparations
- `src/04_test_descriptions/` - Detailed test cases and procedures
- `src/05_requirements_traceability/` - Requirements traceability
- `src/06_notes/` - General information, acronyms, glossary

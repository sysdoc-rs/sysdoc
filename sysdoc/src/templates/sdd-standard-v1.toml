# Software Design Description (SDD)

This document follows DI-IPSC-81435B - Software Design Description.

## Purpose

The Software Design Description (SDD) describes the design of a Computer Software
Configuration Item (CSCI). It describes the CSCI-wide design decisions, the CSCI architectural
design, and the detailed design needed to implement the software. The SDD may be supplemented
by Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs) and Database Design Descriptions (DBDDs).

## Building

Run `sysdoc build` to generate the final document.

3. CSCI-wide design decisions. This section shall be divided into paragraphs as needed to
present CSCI-wide design decisions, that is, decisions about the CSCI's behavioral design
(how it will behave, from a user's point of view, in meeting its requirements, ignoring internal
implementation) and other decisions affecting the selection and design of the software units
that make up the CSCI. If all such decisions are explicit in the CSCI requirements or are
deferred to the design of the CSCI's software units, this section shall so state. Design decisions
that respond to requirements designated critical, such as those for safety, security, or privacy,
shall be placed in separate subparagraphs. If a design decision depends upon system states,
modes or lists, explain the software states and modes. Design conventions needed to
understand the design shall be presented or referenced. Examples of CSCI-wide design
decisions are the following:

a. Input /Output (I/O). Design decisions regarding inputs the CSCI will accept and
outputs it will produce, including interfaces with other systems, HWCIs, CSCIs, and users.
If part or all of this information is given in IDDs, they may be referenced. Define the target
operating system(s). CSCI Behavior for I/O Conditions. Design decisions on software
behavior in response to each input or condition, including actions the CSCI performs,
response times, and other performance characteristics.

b. Equations, algorithms, rules, and handling of un-allowed inputs or conditions.

c. Databases and Data Files. Design decisions on how databases and data files
appear to the end user. If part or all of this information is given in DBDDs, they may be
referenced.

d. Selected approach to meeting safety, security, and privacy requirements.

e. Other Decisions. Other CSCI-wide design decisions made in response to
requirements, such as selected approach to providing required flexibility, availability, and
maintainability.

f. Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). MBSE can be used to develop a set of

4.1. CSCI components. This paragraph shall:

a. Identify the individual software units that make up the CSCI. Each software
unit shall be assigned a unique identifier.

Note: A software unit shall be defined as an element in the design of a CSCI;
for example, a major subdivision of a CSCI, a component of that subdivision, a class, object,
module, function, routine, or database. Software units may occur at different levels of a
hierarchy and may consist of other software units. Software units in the design may or may
not have a one-to-one relationship with the code and data entities (routines, procedures,
databases, data files, etc.) that implement them or with the computer files containing those
entities. A database may be treated as a CSCI or as a software unit. The SDD may refer to
software units by any name(s) consistent with the design methodology being used.

b. Relationships. Show the static (such as "consists of") relationship(s) of the
software units. Multiple relationships shall be presented, depending on the selected
software design methodology (for example, in an object-oriented design or modular open
systems design, this paragraph may present the class and object structures as well as the
module and process architectures of the CSCI).

c. Requirements and Allocation. State the purpose of each software unit, the
CSCI requirements, and the CSCI-wide design decisions allocated to it.

d. Identifying Information. Identify groups of software unit's development
status/type (such as: new development, existing design or software to be reused as is,
existing design or software to be reengineered, software to be developed for reuse,
software planned for Build N, etc.). For existing design or software, the description shall
include identifying information, such as name, version, documentation references, library,
etc.

e. Computer Hardware Resources. Describe the CSCI's (and as applicable, each
software unit's) planned utilization of computer hardware resources (such as processor
capacity, memory capacity, input/output device capacity, auxiliary storage capacity, and
communications/network equipment capacity). The description shall cover all computer
hardware resources included in resource utilization requirements for the CSCI, in system-
level resource allocations affecting the CSCI, and in resource utilization measurement
planning in the Software Development Plan. If all utilization data for a given computer
hardware resource are presented in a single location, such as in another SDD, the referenced
SDD and paragraph shall be stated. Included for each computer hardware resource shall be:

   1. The CSCI requirements or system-level resource allocations being satisfied
   2. The assumptions and conditions on which the utilization data are based (for
      example, typical usage, worst-case usage, assumptions of certain events)
   3. Any special considerations affecting the utilization (such as use of virtual
      memory, overlays, or multiprocessors or the impacts of operating system
      overhead, library software, or other implementation overhead)
   4. The units of measure used (such as percentage of processor capacity, cycles per
      second, bytes of memory, bytes per second)
   5. The level(s) at which the estimates or measures are made (such as software
      unit, CSCI, or executable program)

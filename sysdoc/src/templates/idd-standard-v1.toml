# Interface Design Description (IDD)

This document follows DI-IPSC-81436A - Interface Design Description.

## Purpose

The Interface Design Description (IDD) describes the interface characteristics of one or more
systems, subsystems, Hardware Configuration Items (HWCIs), Computer Software Configuration
Items (CSCIs), manual operations, or other system components. An IDD may describe any number
of interfaces.

The IDD can be used to supplement the System/Subsystem Design Description (SSDD), Software
Design Description (SDD), and Database Design Description (DBDD). The IDD and its companion
Interface Requirements Specification (IRS) serve to communicate and control interface design
decisions.

## Building

Run `sysdoc build` to generate the final document.

## Structure

- `src/01_scope/` - Identification, system overview, document overview

entities (such as different expectations about the size, frequency, or other characteristics of data
elements):

a. Priority assigned to the interface by the interfacing entity(ies)

b. Type of interface (such as real-time data transfer, storage-and-retrieval of
data, etc.) to be implemented

c. Characteristics of individual data elements that the interfacing entity(ies) will
provide, store, send, access, receive, etc., such as:

   1) Names/identifiers:
      a) Project-unique identifier
      b) Non-technical (natural-language) name
      c) DOD standard data element name
      d) Technical name (e.g., variable or field name in code or database)
      e) Abbreviation or synonymous names

   2) Data type (alphanumeric, integer, etc.)

   5) Range or enumeration of possible values (such as 0-99)

   6) Accuracy (how correct) and precision (number of significant digits)

   7) Priority, timing, frequency, volume, sequencing, and other constraints, such as
      whether the data element may be updated and whether business rules apply

   8) Security and privacy constraints

   9) Sources (setting/sending entities) and recipients (using/receiving entities)

d. Characteristics of data element assemblies (records, messages, files, arrays, displays,
reports, etc.) that the interfacing entity(ies) will provide, store, send, access, receive, etc., such
as:

   1) Names/identifiers:
      a) Project-unique identifier
      b) Non-technical (natural language) name
      c) Technical name (e.g., record or data structure name in code or database)
      d) Abbreviations or synonymous names

   2) Data elements in the assembly and their structure (number, order, grouping)

   3) Medium (such as disk) and structure of data elements/assemblies on the medium

   4) Visual and auditory characteristics of displays and other outputs (such as
      colors, layouts, fonts, icons and other display elements, beeps, lights)

   5) Relationships among assemblies, such as sorting/access characteristics

   6) Priority, timing, frequency, volume, sequencing, and other constraints, such as
      whether the assembly may be updated and whether business rules apply

   7) Security and privacy constraints

   8) Sources (setting/sending entities) and recipients (using/receiving entities)

e. Characteristics of communication methods that the interfacing entity(ies) will use for
the interface such as:

   1) Project-unique identifier(s)
   2) Communication links/bands/frequencies/media and their characteristics
   3) Message formatting
   4) Flow control (such as sequence numbering and buffer allocation)
   5) Data transfer rate, whether periodic/aperiodic, and interval between transfers
   6) Routing, addressing, and naming conventions
   7) Transmission services, including priority and grade
   8) Safety/security/privacy considerations, such as encryption, user authentication,
      compartmentalization, and auditing

f. Characteristics of protocols that the interfacing entity(ies) will use for the interface,
such as:

   1) Project-unique identifier(s)
   2) Priority/layer of the protocol
   3) Packeting, including fragmentation and reassembly, routing, and addressing
   4) Legality checks, error control, and recovery procedures
   5) Synchronization, including connection establishment, maintenance, termination
   6) Status, identification, and any other reporting features

g. Other characteristics, such as physical compatibility of the interfacing entity(ies)
(dimensions, tolerances, loads, voltages, plug compatibility, etc.)

NOTE: Copy this file for each interface and replace the heading with the project-unique
interface identifier. Update section numbers accordingly (3.2, 3.3, 3.4, etc.).
